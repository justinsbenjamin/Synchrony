# Justin Benjamin
# Synchrony Project

# I am investigting hatching synchrony in PÅ«keko 
# (Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) as a possible evolutionary route 
# to joint laying behaviour. I will be exploring the hatching spread, 
# hatching rate, and survival of single female and joint female nests 
# and looking at the distribution of hatching.
