# Justin Benjamin
# Synchrony Project

# I am investigating hatching synchrony in PÅ«keko (Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) 
# as a possible evolutionary route to joint laying behaviour in this species. 
# I hypothesize that jointly laying synchronously with a close relative increases
# the inclusive fitness of the dominant female compared to hypothetical 
# prolonged laying by a single female. 
# I will be exploring the estimated and true hatching spread, hatching rate, 
# and survival of single female and joint female nests and looking at 
# the distribution of hatching. I am interested to see if factors like 
# clutch size, group size, clutch number, joint/single female clutches, and level 
# of inbreeding have impacts on hatching synchrony and reproductive success.
