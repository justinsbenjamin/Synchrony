####   OBSERVATIONAL DATA   ####
################################

#### CH.2 INTRO AND HYPOTHESES ####
# I am investigating nesting factors in PÅ«keko (Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) to
# explore the effects of hatching spread (HS) on hatching success and survival.
# The data for chapter 2 has been compiled from field books and spreadsheets to create a 
# master dataset with both summary data for all nests along with specific 
# hatching data for individual nests. Data is from the years 2008, 2010, 2013, 
# 2014-2018, 2022-2024. 

# HYPOTHESIS 1: Dominant females lay synchronously with another female to increase 
# their inclusive fitness. 
# PREDICTION 1a: Shorter HS have better hatching success
# PREDICTION 1b: Shorter HS have better survival

# HYPOTHESIS 2: Females lay together because the optimal clutch size is greater 
# than the size of single female clutches regardless of hatch spread.
# PREDICTION 2a: Larger clutches hatch more eggs 
# PREDICTION 2b: Larger broods have more survivors
# PREDICTION 2c: Larger clutches have greater hatching spread 

# HYPOTHESIS 3: Subordinate females benefit more from synchronous nests
# PREDICTION 3a: Hatch order less important with short HS

#### SYNCHRONY EXPERIMENT ####
##############################

#### CH.3 INTRO AND HYPOTHESIS ####
# Here we experimentally lengthened and shortened the HS of nests 
# in PÅ«keko by using known laying dates, candling images, and flotation scores.

# HYPOTHESIS: Jointly laying synchronously with a close relative increases
# the inclusive fitness of the dominant female compared to hypothetical 
# prolonged laying of a similar sized clutch by a single female.

# PREDICTION A: Synch nests have greater hatching success than Asynch nests 
# as there are fewer eggs deserted in the nest after hatching. 
# PREDICTION B: Synch nests have greater survival than Asynch nests as there 
# are fewer late hatching chicks with poorer survival chances.
