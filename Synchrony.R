############################

#### CH.2 INTRO AND HYPOTHESES ####
# I am investigating nesting factors in PÅ«keko (Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) 
# to explore the effects of hatching spread (HS) on hatching success and 
# survival. The data for chapter 2 has been compiled from field books and 
# spreadsheets to create master data sets with both summary data for all 
# nests along with specific hatching data for individual nests. This data is
# from the years 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014-2018, 2022-2024. 

# HYPOTHESIS 1: Dominant females lay synchronously with another female to 
# increase their inclusive fitness. 
# PREDICTION 1a: Shorter HS have better hatching success
# PREDICTION 1b: Shorter HS have better survival

# HYPOTHESIS 2: Females lay together because the optimal clutch size is 
# greater than the size of single female clutches regardless of hatch spread.
# PREDICTION 2a: Larger clutches hatch more eggs 
# PREDICTION 2b: Larger broods have more survivors
# PREDICTION 2c: Larger clutches have greater hatching spread 

# HYPOTHESIS 3: Subordinate females benefit more from synchronous nests
# PREDICTION 3a: Hatch order less important with short HS

#### PREDICTION 1a: Shorter HS have greater hatching success ####

## Model analyzing the hatching rate by hatching spread. 
## I don't know how to analyze this. Obviously I could do just the number of 
## hatched eggs but then I think I'll need to add clutch size as a co-variate?

## BMB: it should be a binomial (or beta-binomial) model with clutch size as
## the weight, i.e.
## glmmmTMB(prop_survived ~ ..., weights = clutch_size, ...)

## BMB: surprising that the heteroscedasticity in check_models homogeneity-of-variance
## (scale-location) plot doesn't get flagged by DHARMa
## I'm a little surprised at treating Survived_2_cons as Poisson rather than as
##  something like a binomial.  Do you have the denominators (i.e., the total
##  possible survivors for each case)?

# We experimentally lengthened and shortened the HS of nests PÅ«keko by using

# HYPOTHESIS: Jointly laying synchronously with a close relative increases
# the inclusive fitness of the dominant female compared to hypothetical 
# prolonged laying of a similar sized clutch by a single female.

# PREDICTION A: Synchronous nests have greater hatching success than 
# Asynchronous nests as there are fewer eggs deserted in the nest after hatching.

# as there are fewer late hatching chicks with poorer survival chances.
